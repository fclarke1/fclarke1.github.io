:::{#hero-heading}

I'm a Data Scientist based in London, recently graduated from UCL with my Masters in Data Science & Machine Learning.

I love creating little things to understand how things fundamentally work. That's what this site is for, so I've got somewhere to put my little [explorations](exploration/index.qmd) of topics.
